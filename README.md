## Biggest challenges for this project

- couldn't get the right selector on societe.com at first
- bootstrap couldn't be setup on Vue 3
- couldn't connect to linkedin.com with puppeteer because of verification

## Feedback

It was a really good challenge. Allowed me to improve my backend skills with Node :

- create a server
- make API calls
- scrap data from a website playing with HTML selectors

and practice Vue again :

- create a Vue project
- use a CSS library
- use Vuex to do state management
- consuming data from api
