## Feedback

It was a really good challenge. Allowed me to improve my backend skills with Node :

- create a server
- make API calls
- scrap data from a website playing with HTML selectors

and practice Vue again :

- create a Vue project
- use a CSS library
- use Vuex to do state management
- consuming data from api
